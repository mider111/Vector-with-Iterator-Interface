# Vector-with-Iterator-Interface
A class called VectorIterator that implements the Java Iterator interface for the Java Vector class. The code does not use any of the methods in the Vector class that provide iterators. The class supports the remove() method. There is also a JUnit test class called TestVectorIterator that tests your VectorIterator class.
